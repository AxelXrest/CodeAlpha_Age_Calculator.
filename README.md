## Overview

The Age Calculator is a web application built with JavaScript that enables users to calculate their age based on their date of birth. In addition to calculating age, the app integrates the Wikipedia API to display a famous person born on the same day and month as the user’s input. This project offers both age calculation and an engaging feature that connects users with notable historical figures.

## Features

- **Date of Birth Input:**  
  Users can enter their date of birth using dropdown menus for day, month, and year.  
  The dropdowns are dynamically populated with valid day, month, and year options.

- **Calculate Age:**  
  The application calculates the user's exact age based on the provided date of birth and displays the result, including years, months, days, hours, minutes, and seconds.

- **Age Display:**  
  The age is displayed in a clear and readable format with years underlined and highlighted with a glowing effect.  
  A detailed breakdown of months, days, hours, minutes, and seconds is initially hidden and can be revealed when hovered over.

- **Famous Birthdays:**  
  The application fetches a famous person born on the same day as the user's birthday using the Wikipedia API.  
  A random famous personality from the same day is displayed with an image and a brief description.

- **Responsive Design:**  
  The app adjusts automatically to different screen sizes, providing a mobile-friendly experience for users on all devices.

- **Background Video:**  
  The background features a looping video that creates an immersive atmosphere while not distracting from the main content.
